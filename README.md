# NaoTH-DeepLearning
This repo contains tools for datasets, learning, compiling and evaluating neural networks. This is for all deep learning done as part of the RoboCup SPL efforts of the Berlin United Team.

Each folder corresponds to one project. A project might be whistle detection, ball detection on patches, yolo ball detection, object detection on full images, etc. Commonly used functions should go into the tools folder.
